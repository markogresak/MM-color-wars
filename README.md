# Color Wars

This project was created as a part of [Mathematical Modelling](https://ucilnica.fri.uni-lj.si/course/view.php?id=25&lang=en) course at [Faculty of Computer and Information Science, Ljubljana](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/).

*Color Wars* is a simulation, which takes place on a square, randomly generated field, where each iteration a color changes to a random, not necessarily different, neighbor color. The goal was to prove that chances for a color to win is equal to initial share of that color on the field.
